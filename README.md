3. Bootstrap: used to create the user interface.

## Challenges faced by developers of project <a name='challenges'></a>
### Markdown Challenges <a name='mdchallenges'></a>
---------
1. Learning the Markdown programming language.
2. Learning how to add an image from a repository folder into the README documentation.

### Web Storage API Challenges <a name='apichallenges'></a>
---------
1. Researching the localStorage web storage object and how we could utilise it for this project.
2. Researching arrays to keep better track of the people and project objects.
3. Researching classes to make the creation of the person and project classes more efficient.
4. Learning about JavaScript JSON to help keep the objects we store to the localStorage as an object as things are stored as strings by default to the localStorage. 
5. Researching about adding images to objects using JavaScript for the profile pictures of the people objects.
6. Reasearching how to pass objects as parameters of functions.
7. Getting the dot operator working for ticket objects retrieved from the local storage. 
---------
### Bootstrap Challenges <a name='bschallenges'></a>
---------
1. Creating a popup form using HTML and CSS.
2. Learning the Bootstrap programming language.
3. As the we do not know how many issues are going to be added to the bug tracker website, we needed to use JavaScript to add a list element everytime a form was submitted. This was done using an on click event.
